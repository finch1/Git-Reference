|Work|With my help:|
|------------|---------------------|
|Support RGOs to improve their XML submission quality. | <ul><li>Extract submitted data from various tables</li><li>Perform data quality checks</li><li>Comunicated via emails and support calls. Mentioned issues and errors which are effecting our searches and analysis</li><li>resulted in less data cleaning steps</li><li>more streamlined data coding and scripts due to less logic required to transform data</li><li>Lead to an idea to develop a transaction DWH with change tracking</li></ul>|
|Maintain and upgrade SQL reporting scripts and production stored procs. | <ul><li>Debugging errors occuring in production</li><li>Using SQL profiler to identify the process causing an issue as well as re using existing code</li><li>Minimize service time when debugging myself</li><li>Able to develop solutions myself</li></ul>|
|Maintain and upgrade instances, backups, storage, errors, mirroring from prod to test, test env for subject persons, internal training and development env. | <ul><li>Database administration / user roles and permissions</li><li>created a space for external users to test and train new ideas and upgrade features</li><li>Each system comprises of Webserver, Frontend Database + services, Backend database + services</li><li>Development Env for testing upgrades</li></ul>|
|Configured a job to run SQL Blitz to capture instance monitoring data. Idea is to improve performance |<ul><li>Am scripting queries to collect general data from each instance and store it in the reporting DB. Tables are only visible to IT admins</li><li>Created Synonyms on DBB01 to access tables on reporting DB</li><li>All data will be requested by C# script run from DBB01</li><li>Luke configured port rules between all instances</li></ul>|
|Representing in International cooperation. Prepared the presentation of work so far. Collaborate with International Virtual Community. | Shared our solutions with others, determine priorities and collaborations. Brought back ideas such as using front page HTML as a news board.|
|Occasional, one off data extract for specific insight. | Aggregated data to monitor progress and confirm concepts |
|Participation and lead in milestone planning and actioning. | Expertise on system to plan and collaborate with other team members. Progress and expand organisation for future plans. Need to furter train on new tools and adapt. Understand organisaion's work flow and project management. |
|Install DR SQL instances and documented failover with log shipping. | having a backup mirrored and monitored to switch to in case of failure. Tested failover procedure|
|Extract production data to Word, Excel, XML for dissemination using C# and SQL. |<ul><li>Custom data transformations</li><li>group repetitive tasks and data</li><li>disseminated reports to other countries</li><li>Automate repetitive steps</li><li>Consistent data sent to other countries and imported in prod DB</li><li>Involves understanding documentations and collaborating in a team</li><li>Preliminary data check queries and ideas for future project to display errors and rectify data quality</li><li>XML Extraction required understanding documentation and schema. Chose Python to learn new tools and concepts</li></ul>|
|Added Step In goAML DBB01 Notification job to send an email to analysts that they have unread messages on message board for closed reports and cases. | notifications on possible missed information sent late after the report was closed|
|Enabled DB Auditing. | Using audits, I can keep track of user queries|
|Implemented a conversion tool to automatically convert new XBR reports to goAML XML in one day |<ul><li>Way less manual inputting of data leading to accuracy and less missing info</li><li>users can import data already formatted to schema requirements</li><li>code identifies text longer then 4000 characters and saves text to attachment then zip. Previously, data was truncated</li><li>Users can chose to integrate any data they wish to help with their investigation</li><li>Developed out of self interest</li><li>short development time. Used static class</li></ul>|
|Proposed and assisted on an idea to add HTML references to goAML front page | External users have quick and direct access to useful documentation. We can keep external users more up to date with our changes. Matt implemented idea to add button to front page for registration document|
|Developed a conversion tool in Python. When coding python Parser I found these difficulties | <ul><li>Had to add SQL Engine users to Admin Group in Computer management</li><li>installed python packages with target folder so when the app is executing, libraries are found for the user executing the app</li><li>removed and re added permissions on C:\ python folder for SQL Engine users</li><li>with persistence i managed to get it working on its own</li><li>XML Data is easily accessible in tabular format</li></ul>
|Created a simple C# app for QR Resets | <ul><li>no more tickets</li><li>supporting customers instantly</li><li>Used synonyms for data security and user doesnâ€™t have to authenticate with front end</li><li>Created a QR Reset Code</li><li>Created out of self interest as the web site does not support this feature</li></ul>|
| Gained experience using Filestream | Having files external from the database, viruses where detected after restoring production database. Realized after DBCC Check failed. Created a blank text file with the same filestream name to solve DBCC Check |
|Deplyed goAML v5.2 | <ul><li>Deleted a lot of attachments and audit to reduce DB size to fit two instances on on HDD</li><li>Persistance</li><li>Familarize myself with upgrade process, Web before backend<>issues with scripts communicated with UN</li><li>Web required minor configurations</li></ul>|
|Gathered feedback from staff to improve ticketing and delaing with issues | <ul><li>Rearranged the goaml ticketing categories and drop downs</li><li>Provided training to analysts of new changes</li><li>Configured a filter to list: goAML requests, issues I updated in the past two weeks</li><li>Built a PowerBI chart to show ticket trends</li><li>Further organising my time; created Projects filters listing updates in the past two weeks</li></ul>|
